# Your Prompt Library

`v0.7.0`

Your Prompt Library is a local-first macOS desktop app for collecting AI prompts in folders. It is built with Electrobun, Bun, React, and a file-backed Markdown store so prompts stay readable and portable on disk.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev:hmr
```

If you prefer the bundled desktop flow without Vite HMR:

```bash
bun run start
```

## Testing

```bash
bun run test
```

## Production build

```bash
bun run build
```

## TestFlight package

```bash
bun run package:testflight
```

## Storage layout

Prompt data is stored locally in the app user-data directory:

- `library/folders.json` contains folder metadata
- `library/prompts/<prompt-id>.md` contains one prompt per Markdown file with frontmatter metadata

That layout is intentionally simple so the app can later grow into import/export or sync features without replacing the core model.
