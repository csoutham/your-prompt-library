# Direct Distribution

This project can now be packaged for direct download outside the Mac App Store.

## Local packaging

If your `Developer ID Application` certificate is installed in Keychain, run:

```bash
bun install
bun run package:direct
```

This produces:

- `release/Your Prompt Library-<version>-arm64.dmg`
- `release/Your Prompt Library-<version>-arm64-mac.zip`

If the following environment variables are also set, the build will be notarised automatically:

- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Without those variables, the build is still signed but notarisation is skipped.

## GitHub Actions automation

The workflow at [direct-release.yml](/Users/Chris/Work/Projects/Apps/PromptStore/.github/workflows/direct-release.yml) builds and uploads direct-download artefacts.

Trigger modes:

- `release.published`
- manual `workflow_dispatch`

Required GitHub secrets:

- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_P12_BASE64`
- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

To populate those secrets quickly for the current GitHub repository, use:

```bash
export APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_P12_PATH="/absolute/path/to/DeveloperIDApplication.p12"
export APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_PASSWORD="<p12-password>"
export APPLE_ID="<your-apple-id-email>"
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="<app-specific-password>"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="<your-apple-team-id>"

./scripts/setup-direct-release-secrets.sh
```

If you want to target a different repository:

```bash
./scripts/setup-direct-release-secrets.sh owner/repo
```

The workflow validates that the GitHub release tag matches `package.json`:

- package version `1.1.0`
- expected release tag `v1.1.0`

## Notes

- Direct distribution uses `Developer ID Application` signing, not the Mac App Store provisioning profile.
- Direct builds target `dmg` and `zip`.
- Mac App Store/TestFlight packaging remains unchanged and still uses `bun run package:testflight`.
